# Sample application

This sample application is a very basic note taking application.
It consists of three modules:

 - `app`: Contains the application itself, with presenters and views;
 - `app-kotlin`: Contains the application itself, with presenters and views using the Kotlin module;
 - `business`: Contains all business logic, such as creating and persisting notes.
